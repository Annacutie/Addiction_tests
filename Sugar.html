<h3>Chouse a, b, or c and right what you have chousen at the end see which letter is more common.</h3>
<ol>
<li>How often do you eat or drink sugary foods or beverages (including ones made with no-calorie sweeteners)?
<ul>
<li>a. Once or twice a month, at most. I'm not big on sweets.</li>
<li>b. I'll have dessert a couple of times per week, but I rarely drink regular or diet sod</li>
<li>c. Pretty much every day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What's your typical breakfast like?
<ul>
<li>a. Scrambled eggs with vegetables, avocado toast, or even last night's leftovers.</li>
<li>b. Greek yogurt, oatmeal with fruit, or a smoothie.</li>
<li>c. Sugary cereal, a muffin, or a breakfast cookie.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li >How much sugar or sweetener do you usually add to your coffee?
  <ul>
<li>a. None.</li>
<li>b. A teaspoon or one packet.</li>
<li>c. Two teaspoons or two packets. At least.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How often do you go out of your way to get something sugary—like stopping at the store just to buy candy?</li>
<ul class="rule_breakers">
<li>a. Almost never.</li>
<li>b. Every once in a while, if I get a crazy craving for something.</li>
<li>c. Often—like, at least once a week.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do you ever eat sugary foods secret
<ul>
  <li>a. No, If I'm having dessert, it's part of a meal or an event with others.</li>
   <li>b. A couple of times a year I definitely feel like polishing off a pint of ice cream on the couch by myself.</li>
    <li>c. I usually wait to eat dessert until I'm alone, so I can really chow down without anyone judging me.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
 Do you hide sugary foods to eat them later?
<ul>
<li>a. No. Why would I do that?</li>
<li>b. Not usually. But if I know there's only one more piece of Aunt Milly's amazing pie left, I might rearrange a few things in the fridge to make it harder for anyone else to find.</li>
c. Yup, I have a stash of my favorites to enjoy when I'm by myself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Do you ever feel powerless in front of sugary foods or foods made with refined flour, like white bread?
<ul>
<li>a. Rarely. It's just not my thing.</li>
<li>b. Maybe once in a while, if I'm starving. But usually I can have one or two cookies and stop.</li>
c. Yes. Usually once I start eating stuff like that, it's really hard to stop. Even when I'm already full.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
While indulging, do you ever tell yourself that this is the "last time" you'll ever eat like this?
<ul>
<li>a. No.</li>
<li>b. I tried once or twice in the past to cut out sugar, but I realized it wouldn't work in the long run.</li>
c. I tell myself that a lot, and end up feeling bad when I don't follow through.</li>
</ul>
</li>
